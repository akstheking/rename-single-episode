# rename-single-episode
Reanmes single episode to a format.
E.g.,
  arrow.311.hdtv-lo.mp4 to Arrow.S03E11.HDTV.X264--LOL.mp4
I use it by registering it in registry, to appear in right click context-menu.
Sample registry is added as RenameEpi.reg.txt. Rename it to RenameEpi.reg. Change the path in the reg file to location of the jar. Install it.
jar is alos included in project root.
